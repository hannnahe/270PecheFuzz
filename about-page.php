<h5>
Peche-Fuzz is a Seattle based ceramicist.
</h5>
<p>Her favorite fruit is a white peach. </p>
<p>She started Peche-Fuzz from the ground up and is looking forward to continuing to throw clay, hand-build clay, and get dirty!</p>
<p>Peche Fuzz has always been a creator. Aside from playing with clay, she also creates textiles on her loom. Maybe soon she'll figure out how to integrate the two.. To be seen!</p>
